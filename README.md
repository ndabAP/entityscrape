# entityscrape

`entityscrape` is a live demo of the Go module
[assocentity](https://github.com/ndabAP/assocentity), a social science tool to
programmatically analyze entities in non-fictional texts. In particular, it's
well-suited to extract the sentiment for an entity using dependency parsing.
Tokenization is highly customizable and supports the Google Cloud Natural
Language API out-of-the-box.

The live demo gives insights to the following questions:

- How do politicians describe their country in governmental speeches?
- Which current topics correlate with celebrities?
- What are the most common root verbs used in different music genres?
