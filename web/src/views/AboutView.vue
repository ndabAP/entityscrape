    "entitydebs" is a social science tool to programmatically analyze entities in
    non-fictional texts. In particular, it's well-suited to extract the sentiment
    for an entity using dependency parsing. Tokenization is highly customizable and
    supports the Google Cloud Natural Language API out-of-the-box. It can help
    answer questions like:
